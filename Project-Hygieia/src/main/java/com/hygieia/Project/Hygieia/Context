Project-Hygieia

Phase 1 -

Application is a document management system where users can register and upload documents. The application will have the following features:
1) User Registration: Users can register by providing their details such as name, email, and password. The system will validate the input and create a new user account.
2) User can upload documents by providing the document details such as title, description, and the file itself.
3) These files are segregated based on the document category -  Graduation_Document, Government_ID, Corporate_Document, Medical_Document, Other
4) These documents can be viewed on the UI by the category or by All categories.

Phase 2 -

Application will evolve to take up medical documents and will have the following features:
1) Medical document such as Reports, Prescriptions will be saved and categorized.
2) These documents will be processed by AI to have the Prescription date, Doctor's name, Medicines under the prescriptions, Link to buy the prescribed medicines.

Phase 3 -

Application will evolve to be accessible via mobile web app which requires no installation.

Schema -

User Entity-
- id (primary key)
- firstName
- lastName
- email
- password
- List<Document> documents
- createdAt

Document Entity-
- id (primary key)
- title
- description
- uploadedAt
- user_id (for quicker fetching of documents by user id)
- documentCategory (enum - Graduation_Document, Government_ID, Corporate_Document, Medical_Document, Other)
- Upload (OneToOne relationship with Document)

Upload Entity-
- id (primary key)
- fileName
- fileType(pdf/img)
- data

Schema dependency flow - User -> Document (OneToMany) -> Upload (OneToOne) [Unidirectional flow from user to document and document to upload]

Issue 1

- Unable to load the user into the database.
- was able to load it by removing not null constraint upon the user model.
- result was - everything except id is still null.

- find way to actually register a user.

Solved By - Updating the Lombok plugins. also rewritten user model,controller,service,repo.

3) learn hashing of password and implement it in user registration.
5) fetch documents by user id and documentCategory.
6) make changes in the document upload api to assign the document to a user.
7) host backend on aws after password encryption is done.
8) add userResponse dto to fetch user details with documents.
